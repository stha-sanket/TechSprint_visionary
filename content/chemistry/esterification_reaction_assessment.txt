1. In the first step of the esterification mechanism, why does the sulfuric acid catalyst protonate the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid?
A) To make the alcohol a stronger nucleophile.
B) To increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.
C) To neutralize the organic acid before the alcohol is added.
D) To turn the hydroxyl group into a metal precursor.

2. During the reaction, a proton is transferred to one of the hydroxyl groups. What is the functional purpose of this specific step?
A) To create a stable salt.
B) To prevent the sweet smell from escaping.
C) To form a good leaving group (H₂O) that can be eliminated.
D) To increase the pH of the solution to 14.

3. Which of the following describes a structural use of esters in the human body?
A) Creating the calcium structure of bones.
B) Forming the phosphodiester bonds that make up the DNA backbone.
C) Producing hydrochloric acid for the stomach.
D) Acting as a surfactant in the lungs.

4. Fill in the blank: 
Esterification is a type of __________ reaction because it combines two molecules while eliminating a small water molecule.
The explosive compound __________ is an example of an ester used in heavy industry and demolition.

Quick Answer Check
B (Protonation makes the carbon more "attractive" to the alcohol).
C (Water must become a "leaving group" to exit the molecule).
B (Phospho-esters link the genetic code).
